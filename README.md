Role in Internship
To Explore Supervised Machine Learning - In this regression task we will predict the percentage of marks that a student is expected to score based upon the number of hours they studied. This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just two variables.
To Explore Unsupervised Mchine Learning - From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.
To Explore Decision Tree Algorithm - For the given 'Iris' dataset, create a decision tree classifier and visualize it graphically. The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to predict the right classifier correctly.
To explore Business Analytics - To Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on the provided dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’.
